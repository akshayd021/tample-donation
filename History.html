            Sri Lakshminarasimha Swamy temple is located at a village called
            Doddadalavatta, near Madhugiri, in the Tumakur District of the state
            Karnataka, India. Doddadalavatta lies very close to the border of
            the states Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh. The place is popularly
            known as the “village of temples”. The village houses a number of
            temples like the Eshwara temple, Maramma temple, Mutyalamma temple,
            Kerekodi Satyamma temple, Patalappa and Eralakkaiah temples, other
            than this Laksminarasimha Swamy temple.
          </p>
          <p>
            Doddadalavatta is situated near the border of Andhra Pradesh.
            Although it is a small village, it has immense historical value.
            During the rule of Mahanadu of Madhugiri Rajya which was under the
            Vijayanagara Kingdom, Mahanadu had kept a huge army on this border
            to protect the kingdom. In Kannada language, dodda means big and
            dala means a group or army.This historical village is famous for the
            cluster of ancient t emples constructed during the days of yore –
            Eshwara Temple, Maramma Temple, Muthyalamma Temple, Patalappa
            Temple, Kerekodi Satyamma Temple, Lakshmi Narasimha Temple and
            Eralakkaiah Temple.
          </p>
          <p>
            Origin of Doddadalavatta Lakshmi Narasimha Temple Dala Maharishi, a
            great devotee of Lord Vishnu performed tapasya here under a banyan
            tree and invoked the blessings of Lord Narayana. Pleased by his
            austerities, Lord Narayana gave him darshan in form of Narasimha and
            blessed the sage with a boon. Dala Maharishi requested the Lord to
            be present in this kshetra and bless devotees in the future. The
            Lord then manifested Himself in the form of Lakshmi Narasimha, a
            shaligrama shila. Later in the year 1982, another Deity of Lord
            Lakshmi Narasimha was established next to the Swayambhu Shaligrama
            Shila who also continues to give darshan to devotees.
          </p>
          <p>
            Festivals of Doddadalavatta Lakshmi Narasimha Temple During the
            Ashada month, the Brahmotsava festival is celebrated very grandly in
            the temple, apart from the Narasimha Jayanti Festival.

          <p>
            Doddadhalavatta village lies at a distance of 38 km from the town of
            Madhugiri and is around 16 km from Hindupur. The place is also
            famous for the Red Rubi Stones that are available in plenty here.
            This place is believed to have had business ties with the Nawabs of
            Rajastan in the olden times.
          </p>
          <p>
            The holy shrine of Lord Lakshminarasimha Swamy is historically
            significant. The shrine is believed to have received the patronage
            of the Vijayanagara rulers. The village fell under the jurisdictions
            of Mahanadu, under the Madhugiri kingdom. Madhugiri Kingdom came
            under the control of the Vijayanagar rulers. A big contingent of
            army called as Doddadala (Big army of soldiers) was established here
            in order to protect its borders. It is said that Mahanadu Prabhu of
            Madhugiri kingship Sri Chikkappa Gowda had named the place “
            Doddadalavatta”, in memory of his victory over Palyagar Byrendra of
            Karehalli. Palyagar had invaded the place, which resulted in the
            battle of Penugonda. Raja Chikappa Gowda tasted victory in the
            battle with the help of this border army contingent.
          </p>

          <p>
            Another legend informs us about the construction of a temple
            dedicated to this deity. Once, Few traders from Hindupur who were
            passing this place, happened to camp here temporarily. This place
            was surrounded by dense forest. It is said that unknowingly they
            used the stone formation of the lord along with other normal stones
            as a burner stove to cook their food. The food they prepared became
            red with blood. The Traders were scared to see this transformation.
            However, the lord appeared before them in the form of a boy and told
            about their miss deed. He also asked them to build a temple as
            repentance. The traders did as instructed and hence came this temple
            into existence.
